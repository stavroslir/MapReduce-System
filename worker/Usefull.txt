I have created a testing for the worker.
It interacts with a fake Master just for testing.
It works.
Only tried it with one worker.
Commands to follow.

Fake master:
    run: python3 fakemaster.py
    Requests:
        MAP:
            curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"task_type": "MAP", "input_path": "/app/test", "output_path": "/app/out.txt"}' http://localhost:8080/assign_task
        SHUFFLE:
            curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"task_type": "MAP", "input_path": "/app/test", "output_path": "/app/out.txt"}' http://localhost:8080/assig"SHUFFLE", "input_path":"/app/out.txt", "output_path":"/app/shuffle_output"}' http://localhost:8080/assign_task
        REDUCE:
            curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"task_type":"REDUCE", "input_path":"/app/shuffle_output", "output_path":"/app/reduce_output"}' http://localhost:8080/assign_task
